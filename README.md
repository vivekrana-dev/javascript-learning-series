# Day 1 - JavaScript: var, let, const

## âœ… What I Learned Today
- How to declare variables using `var`, `let`, and `const`
- Differences between function scope and block scope
- Which variables can be reassigned or redeclared

## ðŸ“Œ Key Points
- `var` is function-scoped, can be redeclared and reassigned.
- `let` is block-scoped, can be reassigned but not redeclared in the same scope.
- `const` is block-scoped and cannot be reassigned or redeclared.
